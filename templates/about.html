  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p>
    The <b>AI Lost & Found Portal</b> is a web-based system developed using <b>Python (Flask)</b> and <b>MySQL</b> that helps users to
    report and locate lost or found items efficiently. This platform aims to bridge the gap between individuals who have lost
    their belongings and those who have found unclaimed items.
  </p>

  <p>
    The portal uses a simulated <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> logic that analyzes the description of a found item and predicts 
    the most likely owner’s name with a <b>confidence score</b>. This represents how AI can assist humans in making 
    smart, data-driven decisions in real-world applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users can report both <b>found items</b> and <b>lost items</b> with details such as item name, description, and category. 
    All records are stored securely in a MySQL database, making the process organized and easy to track. 
    The system demonstrates how database management, web development, and AI logic can work together to create a practical solution.

  <h2>About the Developer</h2>

  <p>
    I am <b>Ankit Negi</b>, currently pursuing a <b>Master of Computer Applications (MCA)</b> from <b>DIT University, Dehradun</b>.
    My passion lies in creating intelligent and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems through
    programming, logic, and innovation.
  </p>

  <p>
    This project was built as part of my academic journey, where I explored how AI and web technologies can collaborate
    to enhance everyday experiences. Through this, I aimed to show how even small applications can make a big impact
    when designed with the right combination of creativity and technology.

  <p class="closing-line">
    The <b>AI Lost & Found Portal</b> is more than a project — it’s a step toward integrating Artificial Intelligence 
    into practical, real-life use cases that make human tasks easier, faster, and more reliable.
